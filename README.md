Python | Machine Learning | Stats | Parametric Model | Non-Parametric Mode | Data Analysis | Hyperparameter Optimization

The objective is to build data science models that yield valuable insights into the
two crucial business questions: identifying the customer segments most responsive to marketing
campaigns and deriving effective business strategies. To achieve this, you are required to:
• Develop statistical learning models that can predict the success of a marketing campaign for
a given customer.
• Extract at least three insights that can assist the company in making informed decisions
regarding their marketing campaigns.
Your report must show results for at least two different sets of predictions.
• At least one of your models should be a parametric model.
• At least one of your models should be a non-parametric model.
